# Plans Together Guides

This is the repo for [guides.planstogether.net](https://guides.planstogether.net) and contains all of the guides available on the site.

Guides can be found in `src/content` directory as `.mdx` files. The guides should all be written as markdown and get converted automatically to HTML on build

## Contributing

There are many ways you can contribute to the Plans Together Guides, not just be writing guides, but also by keeping them up to date, fixing broken links and translatin guides into other languages

If you find something that isn't right, fix it and submit a PR. If for whatever reason, you aren't able to fix it, make a GitHub Issue and someone who can will fix it instead

### Guide Writing Guide

(bit of a mouthful!)

When writing guides, please uses clear straight forward language, using:

- Shorter paragraphs
- Few assumptions about existing knowledge (link to other guides where appropriate)
- Explain acronyms and abbreviations
- Simpler vocabulary with less jargon

This makes it easier for people who are frustrated, non-native or have cognitive difficulties
